<h1>The INTERLIS-Compiler</h1>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>
For the current version of ili2c, you will need a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed on your system, version 1.3 or later.
</p>

<h2>Installing ili2c</h2>

<p>
To install ili2c, choose a directory and extract the distribution file there.
</p>

<h2>Running ili2c</h2>

<p>
There is currently no launcher. ili2c can be started with
</p>
<code>
java -jar ili2c.jar [options]
</code>
<p>
If you run the compiler without any options, a GUI (Graphical User Interface)
will appear.
</p>
<h2>Graphical User Interface</h2>
<h3>Input tab</h3>
Use this tab, to define options, that the compiler will read while running.
<h4>Files</h4>
<p>This contains the list of INTERLIS schema and metadata basket files, that the compiler will read and
check. The ordering of the entries is significant. Use the <code>Move up</code>
and/or <code>Move down</code> buttons to reorder the list.</p>
<h4>Add Model (.ili)...</h4>
Use this button to add a new INTERLIS schema file to the list of files, that the
compiler should check.
<h4>Add Metadata basket (.xml)...</h4>
Use this button to add a new metadata basket file to the list of files, that the
compiler should check. Metadata baskets are used by the compiler, to check
references from the schema files to graphical symbols or (coordinate-) reference systems.
<h4>Remove</h4>
Use this button to remove the selected entry from the list of files.
<h4>Move up</h4>
Use this button to move the selected entry one line up. The ordering of the entries is significant.
<h4>Move down</h4>
Use this button to move the selected entry one line down. The ordering of the entries is significant.

		<h4>Mappings</h4>
		<p>
		This list contains the mappings from names of metadata basket declarations (as part of an INTERLIS schema) to BIDs (Basket Identifier) of real existing metadata baskets (as part of a XML file). See also the chapter with the syntax rule MetaDataUseDef in the INTERLIS language definition.
</p>
		<h4>check if referenced metaobjects exist</h4>
		<p>Select this button, if you like the compiler to check, if referenced metaobjects exist. If this button is not selected, you don't have to define mappings, and the compiler assumes that all referenced metaobjects exist.</p>
		<h4>Add mapping...</h4>
		<p>
Use this button to add new mapping.
</p>
		<h4>Edit mapping...</h4>
		<p>Use this button to edit the selected mapping entry. </p>
		<h4> Remove</h4>
		
		Use this button to remove the selected entry from the list of mappings.

		<h3>Output tab</h3>
		
Use this tab to provide options, that control the files that the compiler will generate.
<h4>Kind of output</h4>
Defines the kind of output, that the compiler will generate. If you just like to check
your INTERLIS schemas, select <code>Generate no output</code>.
<h4>Filename</h4>
Enter the name of the file, that the compiler will write, if you didn't choose to generate no output.
<h4>Report Errors and warnings</h4>
Select this button, if you like to see errors and warnings.
<h4>Report only errors</h4>
Select this button, if you like to see only errors.
<h4>Include the predefined MODEL INTERLIS</h4>
The INTERLIS language includes a predefined base model (see Annex A in the language
definition). Select this button, if you like to include it in the generated
output. This option is normally not useful.
<h3>lower area</h3>
<h4>Compiler messages</h4>
If your INTERLIS schema does not follow the INTERLIS language description, you will see
here messages that point you to the problems.
<h4>Run compiler</h4>
Use this button to start a new compiler run. The compiler will then check any
INTERLIS schema files, that you have added to the files list and generate the
output file, that you defined on the output tab.
