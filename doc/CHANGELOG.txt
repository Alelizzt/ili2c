- no code changes
- build process changed to ant (jakarta.apache.org)

ilic 0.98 (not released yet)
----------------------------

- generation of XML DTDs
- import of meta objects via XML
- entirely different handling of line attributes
- common code for generating INTERLIS-2 CLASS, VIEW, PROJECTION, GRAPHIC
  and STRUCTURE

  polymorphism
- large changes in view syntax and semantics, added projections
- new UNIT INTERLIS.DIMENSIONLESS
- in certain cases, more informative error messages are generated
- term parser can now special-case depending on the expected type,
  which is derived from the type of the lvalue (was needed for
  assigning references to meta objects to parameters)
- more type checking for assigning constant values to parameters
- numerous bug fixes
- simple invocation of test suite: "make -s check" Works only
  on machines with POSIX tools (tested with GNU/Linux; should work
  with GNU/Hurd, Digital TruUNIX, MacOS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD etc, as well).
  Might work on Windows when cygwin tools are installed.
